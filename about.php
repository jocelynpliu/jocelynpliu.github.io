            My name is <b>Jocelyn Liu</b>. <br> I am finishing up my 3rd year in the <b>Computer Science program</b> at USC.
            <br> <br>
            In addition to being a full time student, <b>I am an actor</b>. I have been professionally acting since I was 17 years old. 
            <br> <br>
            This project was a fun opportunity for me to showcase both sides of my life. I've had this idea in my head for long time to create a website that could accurately capture what it feels like to have one foot in two differents worlds.
